You know I'd take it all back, take it all back, take it all back
I'd take it all back just to have you
You know I'd take it all back, take it all back, take it all back
I'd take it all back just to have you
I'm waking up
Hey, my life is real great, feel I'm well on my way to my dreams coming true and I'm getting to do with you
And it feels so nice when the people sing along, they're singing along with the banjo
But I'd take it all back, take it all back, take it all back
I'd take it all back just to have you
You know I'd take it all back, take it all back, take it all back
I'd take it all back just to have you
I'm waking up
And one day we might have a big house with nice cars and fancy clothes and a wife with a big ol' diamond ring
'Cause the people they dancing along, they dancing along to the mando' and some sort of hip-hop beat
But I'd take it all back, take it all back, take it all back
I'd take it all back just to have you
And I'd take it all back, take it all back, take it all back
I'd take it all back just to have you
I'm waking up
I'm waking up
I'm waking up
I'm waking up
I'm waking up
I'm waking up
I'm waking up
I'm waking up
But I'd take it all back, take it all back, take it all back
I'd take it all back just to have you
And I'd take it all back, take it all back, take it all back
I'd take it all back just to have you
I'm waking up
I'm waking up
Hey, my life is real great, feel I'm well on my way to my dreams coming true true true and I'm getting to do with you
